Manuscript title: Surrogate GPR139 Agonists Reverse Short-Term Startle Habituation Impairment in Larval Zebrafish
This repository stored the scripts (MATLAB and ImageJ Macro Language) to quantify habenula neuron recordings for experiments of spontaneous activity and pERK immunostaining for the manuscript mentioned above.
Two scripts (step 1/one and step 2/two) for each experiment.
