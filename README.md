Manuscript title: Surrogate GPR139 Agonists Reverse Short-Term Startle Habituation Impairment in Larval Zebrafish
This repository stored the scripts (MATLAB and ImageJ Macro Language) for the quantification of habenula neuron recordings for experiments of spontaneous activity and pERK immunostaining for the above-mentioned manuscript.
Two scripts (step 1/one and step 2/two) for each experiment.
